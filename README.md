__**Version 1.5**__

* Added shallow and pointless (SPD) discussion category, to be posted in the morning! Is it time for a name change? owo
* Send Dee your shallow and pointless prompts through DM, by starting with `spd` and then the rest as usual. Thanks Scur! <3

__**Version 1.4**__

* Dee now has anon mode! DM `answer "<type answer here>"` to Dee, and she'll deliver it here!
* Fixed version spam, and fixed that full stop in the 1.3 notes! >:(
* Added prompt for when there will be no question tomorrow (don't let Dee get lonely pls ;~;)
* Changed 'no questions' prompt to function like normal voting (but in reverse)

* Old questions are unpinned when a new question is posted.
* Sending Dee a message in the save question format will skip intro dialog for new users.
* Swatted no dupe questions / reaction question cycling bugs.
